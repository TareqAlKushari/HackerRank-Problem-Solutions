## Languages & Topics Covered

- **C++**: Multiple subdirectories providing solutions for problems on classes, pointers, strings, attribute parsing, and variable-sized arrays.
- **Java**: Solutions such as string manipulation and log-level parsing.
- **Data Structures**: Foundational problems and explanations.
- **Certifications**: Solutions and documentation for HackerRank certification challenges (e.g., REST API: Patient's Medical Record).

---

## Certifications

Special focus is given to certification problems such as:

- **REST API: Patient's Medical Record**  
  - Solve API-based data tasks, calculate averages, handle pagination, and parse JSON responses.
  - Sample inputs, outputs, and explanations available in [Certifications/REST API Patient's Medical Record/README.md](Certifications/REST%20API%20Patient's%20Medical%20Record/README.md).
