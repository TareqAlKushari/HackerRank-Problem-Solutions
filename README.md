## Overview

This repository contains clean, well‑commented solutions for various HackerRank challenges — from easy warm‑ups to advanced algorithmic problems. It’s organized by domain and programming language to streamline your practice and study routine.

## 📁 Contents

Each section corresponds to either a HackerRank domain or a specific programming language:

```

/
├─ Algorithms/            // Sorting, Search, Graphs, etc.
├─ DataStructures/        // Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.
├─ SQL/                   // Query challenges in SQL
├─ Languages/             // e.g. Python/, Java/, C++/, JavaScript/
└─ README.md

```

Inside each folder, you’ll find:

- Solution files with descriptive filenames.
- Clear inline comments explaining logic and complexities.
- Optional helper scripts or README notes.

## ✅ Prerequisites

To run or modify the solutions:

- Install the required language runtimes/compilers (Python, Java, C++, etc.).
- For SQL solutions, you'll need a MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite environment.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Browse Challenges**: Navigate folders to find problems by domain or language.  
2. **Run Solutions**: Use your local environment to compile/run the script:
   ```bash
   cd Algorithms/TwoSum
   python solution.py
   ```

  or
  
  ```bash
  javac Solution.java
  java Solution
  ```

3. **Add Your Own**: Fork the repo, add a new folder or update an existing one, and include your code following the naming pattern.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Your improvements are always welcome!
